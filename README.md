# parkingMapp

In Stockholm, there are many streets that need to be cleaned. This means that no cars can be parked on specific streets at specific times. This application was created in order to help people who are unsure whether their car is on a 'safe' street.

This app uses Open Stockholm's API, as well as Google Maps APIs. Basically, information is retrieved from Open Stockholm's API and displayed on a map, on which lines in different colors are drawn in order to show which streets are 'safe' and 'unsafe' respectively.

The goal of this project is to facilitate for people with cars to avoid fines. 

There is currently no iOS or Android app released.
