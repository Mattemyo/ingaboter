# parkingMapp

In Stockholm, there are many streets that need to be cleaned. This means that no cars can be parked on specific streets at specific times. Therefore, this app was created in order to help people if they are not sure if their car is on a 'safe' street. 


This app uses Open Stockholm's API, as well as Google Maps APIs. Basically, information is retrieed from Open Stockholm's API and displayed on a map, on which lines in different colors are drawn in order to show which streets are 'safe' and 'unsafe' respectively.



The goal of this project is to make it easier for people with cars to avoid fines. At the moment, there is not yet an iOS or Androind.
